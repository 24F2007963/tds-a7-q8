## Overview
The company is experiencing slowing monthly recurring revenue (MRR) growth. The quarterly MRR growth data for 2024 is as follows:

| Quarter | MRR Growth (%) |
|---------|----------------|
| Q1      | 2.06           |
| Q2      | 7.48           |
| Q3      | 12.54          |
| Q4      | 7.38           |

**Average MRR Growth:** 7.36  
**Industry Target:** 15

## Key Findings
1. The company’s average MRR growth (7.36) is **well below the industry benchmark** of 15%.  
2. The growth trend is **non-linear**: Q1 was very low (2.06), Q3 peaked at 12.54%, but Q4 dropped again to 7.38%.  
3. The company is unable to consistently achieve the target growth rate.

## Business Implications
- Slower MRR growth can limit cash flow and resources for scaling.  
- Falling short of the industry benchmark risks losing market share to competitors.  
- Fluctuating quarterly performance indicates that current strategies may not be sustainable.

## Recommendation
To reach the target MRR growth of 15%, we recommend:  

**→ Expand into new market segments**  
- Identify untapped customer verticals.  
- Offer tailored pricing plans or features for niche segments.  
- Enhance marketing efforts to acquire new customers while retaining existing ones.
